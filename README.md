# üì° Open GNSS Dataset  

This repository provides open-source Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data collected from suburban Hong Kong. The data offer command cases where a dynamic pedestrian user is under a pure multipath interference. The dataset is useful for GNSS research, positioning and navigation studies.

## üèó Experiment Details
- **Location:** Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong  
- **Date (UTC):** 13/02/2025
- **Antenna Type:** [NovAtel (GPS-703-GGG)](https://novatel.com/support/previous-generation-products-drop-down/previous-generation-products/gps-703-ggg-antenna)
- **GNSS Receiver:** [LabSat 3 Wideband](https://www.labsat.co.uk/index.php/en/products/labsat-3-wideband)
- **Ground truth:** [NovAtel SPAN-CPT](https://novatel.com/products/gnss-inertial-navigation-systems), 10 Hz

Fig. 1 provides the experiment setup and test environment. It is likely that the signal coming from the south is reflected on the building surface, and both direct and reflected signals are received. The sky plot in Fig. 1 (b) shows the satellite visibility and signal classification results from ray-tracing techniques. Utilizing user ground truth information, satellite ephemeris, and 3D building models, the ray-tracing algorithm simulates the most possible signal paths. Therefore, it states that PRN 22 is geometrically possible to be multipath interfered during all the test and PRN 5 is geometrically possible to be multipath interfered in several epochs of the test.

Fig. 2 illustrates the pedestrian motion. The pedestrian conducts reciprocating motion perpendicular to the building surface for several reasons. First, enlarge the velocity projection onto the signal path and thereby expand the Doppler shift of the reflected signal. Second, the Doppler shift of the reflected signal experiences varying values in time, which is beneficial to characterize its impact on receiver measurement.
