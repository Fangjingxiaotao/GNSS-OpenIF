# üì° Open GNSS Dataset  

This repository provides open-source Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data collected from a suburban area in Hong Kong. The dataset captures scenarios where a dynamic pedestrian user is subject to pure multipath interference. It is valuable for GNSS multipath detection/mitigation research.

## üìÇ Dataset Contents

## üèó Experiment Details
- **Location:** Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong  
- **Date (UTC):** 13/02/2025
- **Antenna Type:** [NovAtel (GPS-703-GGG)](https://novatel.com/support/previous-generation-products-drop-down/previous-generation-products/gps-703-ggg-antenna)
- **GNSS Receiver:** [LabSat 3 Wideband](https://www.labsat.co.uk/index.php/en/products/labsat-3-wideband)
- **Ground truth:** [NovAtel SPAN-CPT](https://novatel.com/products/gnss-inertial-navigation-systems), 10 Hz

Figure 1 illustrates the experiment setup and test environment. It is likely that signals originating from the south are reflected off the building surface, resulting in the reception of both direct and reflected signals. The sky plot in Figure 1(b) presents satellite visibility and signal classification results obtained from ray-tracing techniques. By incorporating user ground truth information, satellite ephemeris, and 3D building models, the ray-tracing algorithm simulates the most probable signal propagation paths. As a result, the analysis indicates that PRN 22 is geometrically susceptible to multipath interference throughout the entire test, while PRN 5 is likely to experience multipath interference during specific epochs of the experiment.

Figure 2 illustrates the pedestrian's motion pattern. The pedestrian moves back and forth perpendicular to the building surface for several reasons. First, this motion increases the velocity projection onto the signal path, thereby amplifying the Doppler shift of the reflected signal. Second, the time-varying nature of the reflected signal‚Äôs Doppler shift helps characterize its impact on receiver measurements, providing valuable insights into multipath interference effects.
