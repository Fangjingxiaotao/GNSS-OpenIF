# üì° Open GNSS Dataset  

This repository provides open-source Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data collected from urban areas in Hong Kong. The dataset captures the scenario 1 (S1) where a dynamic pedestrian user is moving near a building and the scenario 2 (S2), where a vechile is navigating in a dense urban area. It is valuable for GNSS multipath detection/mitigation research.


## üèó Experiment Details
**Scenario 1:**
- **Location:** Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong  
- **Date (UTC):** 13/02/2025

Figure 1 illustrates the experiment setup and test environment of **scenario 1**. It is likely that signals originating from the south are reflected off the building surface, resulting in the reception of both direct and reflected signals. The sky plot in Figure 1(b) presents satellite visibility and signal classification results obtained from ray-tracing techniques. By incorporating user ground truth information, satellite ephemeris, and 3D building models, the ray-tracing algorithm simulates the most probable signal propagation paths. As a result, the analysis indicates that PRN 22 is geometrically susceptible to multipath interference throughout the entire test, while PRN 5 is likely to experience multipath interference during specific epochs of the experiment.

Figure 2 illustrates the pedestrian's motion pattern. The pedestrian moves back and forth perpendicular to the building surface for several reasons. First, this motion increases the velocity projection onto the signal path, thereby amplifying the Doppler shift of the reflected signal. Second, the time-varying nature of the reflected signal‚Äôs Doppler shift helps characterize its impact on receiver measurements, providing valuable insights into multipath interference effects.

**Scenario 2:**
- **Location:** Mong KoK, Hong Kong  
- **Date (UTC):** 06/03/2025

Figure 3 illustrates the experiment setup and test environment of **scenario 2**. This scenario introduces rapid satellite‚Äìreceiver geometry changes, frequent signal blockages, and high noise levels caused by user dynamics. In our results, several epochs of multipath interference are detected by the ray-tracing with supporting evidence from identifiable reflection geometry. While such intervals are brief, they are sufficient to demonstrate that the proposed estimator converges reliably and is capable of fitting the observed Doppler oscillation behavior.
